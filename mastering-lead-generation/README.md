## Foundations of Positioning & Relationship Leverage

Most sales training teaches you how to close better.

This program teaches you how positioning and relationships shape the quality of the opportunities you receive.

Deal quality is not random.
It is influenced long before you sit at the table.

Over the next 6–8 hours, you will learn how market perception, professional relationships, and ecosystem leverage determine whether you compete… or whether you’re positioned.

This is the shift from selling harder — to being positioned smarter.
