# Lesson 6.2: Follow-Up Messages That Get Replies

## Key idea
Great follow-up messages do three things:
1) remind them who I am  
2) show I listened  
3) make the next step easy

## The 5-part message structure (copy/paste framework)
I use this:

1) **Context:** “Great talking at ___ / about ___.”
2) **Specific recall:** “You mentioned ___.”
3) **Value:** “Here’s ___ that helps.”
4) **Low-pressure next step:** “Want me to ___?”
5) **Exit ramp:** “If now isn’t the time, no worries.”

This makes me feel professional, not pushy.

## Templates I can use immediately

### 1) Same-day recap follow-up
**Subject/DM:** Great talking today  
“Great talking earlier — I wrote down what you said about **___**.  
Here’s **one quick idea** that usually helps: **___**.  
If you want, I can send you a short checklist for **___**.”

### 2) 48-hour “value drop”
“Quick follow-up — based on what you said about **___**, here’s a simple way to think about it:  
**Option A:** ___  
**Option B:** ___  
If you tell me what matters more (speed vs cost vs quality), I can point you the right direction.”

### 3) “Permission-based” next step
“Want me to put together a quick **___** for you?  
No pressure — if it’s helpful, great. If not, totally fine.”

### 4) “Answer the question they didn’t ask”
“Something I didn’t mention earlier: most people run into **___** when they try to **___**.  
If you want, I can show you how to avoid it in 2 minutes.”

### 5) “Closing the loop” (clean and confident)
“Closing the loop on this — do you want to:  
A) move forward this week  
B) circle back later  
C) drop it for now  
No wrong answer — I just want to track it correctly.”

This message gets replies because it’s easy to choose.

## The 3 biggest mistakes (and what I do instead)

### Mistake 1: “Just checking in”
It’s vague and low-value.  
**Instead:** I add a reason + value.

### Mistake 2: Too long
People skim.  
**Instead:** 3–6 lines max. One clear CTA.

### Mistake 3: Asking for a big decision
“Are you ready to buy?” creates pressure.  
**Instead:** I ask for a small next step.

## My “two-sentence follow-up” rule
If I’m unsure what to say, I send:

1) One sentence showing I listened  
2) One sentence offering something useful + a small next step

Follow-up doesn’t need perfect writing. It needs consistency.
