# Lesson 6.3: A Simple CRM System That Keeps Leads Alive

## Key idea
A CRM isn’t a software.  
A CRM is **a decision system** for what I do next.

Tools help, but the real win is having a process I repeat.

## My “minimum viable CRM”
I only need 5 fields:

1) **Name**
2) **Where I met them / context**
3) **Problem they care about**
4) **Status**
5) **Next follow-up date**

That’s it. If my CRM has 27 fields, I’ll stop using it.

## Status stages (simple pipeline)
I use these stages:

- **New** (met them / first convo)
- **Warm** (they replied / interest)
- **Scheduled** (call/meeting set)
- **Active** (in process now)
- **Paused** (not now, later)
- **Closed** (won/lost)

The goal is not perfection — it’s clarity.

## The follow-up engine: reminders + batches
I set my system up so I’m not “remembering,” I’m **reviewing**.

### Daily (5 minutes)
- check “follow-up today”
- send 3–5 messages

### Weekly (20 minutes)
- move stalled leads to “Paused”
- schedule next touches
- add notes from conversations

## Tagging (optional, but powerful)
Tags help me personalize quickly:
- “Budget-sensitive”
- “Needs approval”
- “Comparing options”
- “Urgent timeline”
- “Referred by ___”

## What I do after every conversation (60 seconds)
Before I close my laptop, I write:

- **What they want:** ___
- **Why now:** ___
- **Next step:** ___
- **Follow-up date:** ___

If I do this consistently, I stop losing leads.

## The secret to long-term conversion
Most deals are won by the person who:
- follows up
- stays useful
- stays present
- doesn’t get weird

A CRM makes that automatic.
