## Why This Matters for Deal Quality

Follow-up is not just about closing deals.

It reinforces trust, strengthens positioning, and shapes how you’re remembered inside your network.

Consistent, professional follow-up influences whether future opportunities arrive cold… or pre-framed.

# Module 6: Follow-Up That Converts (Without Being Annoying)

Most people don’t lose leads because they’re bad at talking.  
They lose leads because they *disappear after the first good conversation.*

Follow-up is where trust gets built. It’s also where you prove you’re organized, reliable, and worth choosing.

## What I’ll learn in this module
By the end of Module 6, I will be able to:

- Follow up with confidence, without sounding needy or salesy
- Use simple “value-first” messages that get replies
- Build a repeatable follow-up system so I don’t drop warm leads
- Track leads in a lightweight CRM workflow (even if it’s just notes + tags)

## What’s inside
- **Lesson 6.1:** Why follow-up works (and why most people avoid it)
- **Lesson 6.2:** Follow-up messages that get responses
- **Lesson 6.3:** A simple CRM system that keeps my pipeline alive
- **Exercises:** Build my follow-up templates + a 7-day follow-up plan
- **Quiz:** Confirm I can apply it in real life

## My goal for this module
I will leave this module with:
1) 5 follow-up messages I can send immediately  
2) a follow-up schedule I can repeat  
3) a system that prevents leads from falling through the cracks
