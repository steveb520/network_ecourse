# Connection Builder Workshop (20–30 Minutes)
## Create introductions that spread your name (without sounding salesy)

This isn’t an elevator pitch.  
This is a **connection script**: a clear, human way to describe you so other people can confidently introduce you.

My goal is to make it easy for someone to say:
> “You should talk to ___.”

---

## What we’ll build (in 20–30 minutes)
By the end, I will have:

1) A **1-sentence identity** people can repeat  
2) A **10–15 second spoken intro** for group settings  
3) A **copy/paste text intro** someone can send on my behalf  
4) A short list of **signals** (when to bring me up)  
5) A **clean ask** that activates my network without being weird

# Agenda

## Part 1 (3 min): Why names spread
People share your name when:
- they can explain you in one sentence
- they trust you won’t embarrass them
- they know **when** to bring you up
- the next step is easy

**Rule:** If someone can’t describe you quickly, they won’t recommend you—even if they like you.

## Part 2 (7 min): Build your “repeatable identity”

### A) The 1-sentence identity
Fill in the blanks:

**I help** ____________  
**who are dealing with** ____________  
**so they can** ____________.

Write yours:
> I help __________________________________________  
> who are dealing with ______________________________  
> so they can ______________________________________.

### B) Translate it into “friend language”
Rewrite it without jargon (simple words, normal tone):

> Friend version: ___________________________________

## Part 3 (7 min): Signals — when to mention you
Signals are phrases people say right before they need help.

Signal starters:
- “We’ve been thinking about…”
- “Do you know anyone who…”
- “We’re comparing options…”
- “This has been a headache…”
- “I’m not sure what to do about…”

Write 3 signals your audience says:
1) ________________________________________________
2) ________________________________________________
3) ________________________________________________

Now write your “when to mention me” line:
> If you hear someone say ________________________, that’s when to bring me up.

## Part 4 (7 min): Intros that travel

### A) Spoken intro (10–15 seconds)
This is what someone can say in a group:

> “This is ___ — they help ___ who are dealing with ___.  
> If you ever run into ___, they’re the person to talk to.”

Write yours:
> This is __________ — they help _____________________  
> who are dealing with ______________________________.  
> If you ever run into _______________________________, they’re the person to talk to.

### B) Copy/paste intro (most powerful)
This is what someone can text on your behalf.

**Message 1 (permission):**
> “Hey — you mentioned ____. I know someone solid who helps with that. Want an intro?”

**Message 2 (group text):**
> “Great. Adding them here — (Name), quick context: ____.  
> They’re great at ____. I’ll let you two take it from here.”

Customize yours:

**Message 1:**
> Hey — you mentioned _______________________________.  
> I know someone solid who helps with that. Want an intro?

**Message 2:**
> Great. Adding them here — (Name), quick context: ________.  
> They’re great at ____________________________________.  
> I’ll let you two take it from here.

## Part 5 (3–5 min): Activate your network (clean ask)
Send this to 3 people you already have a relationship with:

> “Quick ask — if you hear anyone mention (signal), I’d appreciate you thinking of me.  
> Here’s an easy intro you can copy/paste:  
> [paste Message 1 + Message 2]”

3 people I’ll send it to:
1) ____________________
2) ____________________
3) ____________________
