# Lesson 4.2: Building a Pitch That Works

A strong elevator pitch follows a simple structure — even if it doesn’t sound structured when spoken.

## The Three-Part Framework

I build pitches around three elements:

### 1. The Problem
What situation, frustration, or challenge do people recognize immediately?

This anchors your pitch in reality.

---

### 2. The Solution
How do you help address that problem?

Keep this outcome-focused, not feature-heavy.

---

### 3. The Direction
What usually happens next?

This opens the door for follow-up without forcing it.

## Example (Abstract, Not Industry-Specific)

“I work with people who feel stuck trying to figure out their next move.  
I help them get clarity and make decisions without overthinking.  
Most conversations start with a simple discussion.”

Notice:
- No buzzwords
- No pitch pressure
- Easy to respond to

## Why This Works

People don’t remember information.
They remember relevance.

A good pitch gives them a reason to stay engaged.
