# Lesson 4.3: Tailoring Your Pitch to Different Audiences

One pitch never fits every situation.

Adaptation is not inconsistency — it’s awareness.

---

## Why Tailoring Matters

Different people care about different things:
- peers care about approach
- decision-makers care about outcomes
- strangers care about clarity

Same work. Different emphasis.

---

## What You Can Adjust

You can tailor:
- language
- examples
- level of detail
- pacing

You should not change:
- your core value
- your integrity
- your intent

---

## Real-Time Adjustment

Pay attention to:
- their questions
- their energy
- their familiarity with the topic

Let the conversation guide the pitch, not the other way around.

---

## Key Insight

The best elevator pitches are not memorized.
They are **understood**.
