# Module 4: Crafting Your Elevator Pitch

Most elevator pitches fail for one simple reason:  
they’re designed to impress instead of connect.

In this module, I focus on building a pitch that feels natural, flexible, and usable in real conversations — not something memorized or robotic.

A good elevator pitch doesn’t sound like a pitch at all.  
It sounds like clarity.
