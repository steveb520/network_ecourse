# Lesson 4.1: What an Elevator Pitch Really Is

An elevator pitch is not a sales speech.

It’s a **clarity tool** — for you and for the person you’re talking to.

## The Real Purpose of an Elevator Pitch

The goal is not to close.
The goal is not to impress.
The goal is not to explain everything.

The goal is simple:
> Help someone quickly understand what you do and why it matters.

If they want more, they’ll ask.

## Why Most Elevator Pitches Feel Awkward

Most people overload them with:
- jargon
- features
- credentials
- unnecessary detail

That creates confusion instead of interest.

---

## A Better Mental Model

Think of your elevator pitch as:
- an opening line
- a conversation starter
- a positioning statement

It should invite curiosity, not demand attention.

---

## Key Insight

If your pitch requires perfect delivery, it’s too fragile.

The best pitches are adaptable and human.
