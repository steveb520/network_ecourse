# Module 3: Building Relationships — Quiz

**Instructions:** answer without looking back first. Then review.

1) In your own words, what is a “lead”?  
2) Give 3 examples of conversation “signals.”  
3) Write one open-ended qualifying question you can use today.  
4) What is a permission-based next step? Give 2 examples.  
5) What is one “value offer” you can deliver in under 60 seconds?

## Answer key (self-check)
- A lead has a problem you can solve and a realistic path to becoming a customer.
- Signals reveal need, urgency, authority, or willingness to engage.
- Great questions invite context, not yes/no.
- Permission-based next steps are low-pressure and respectful (“Want me to…”).
- Value offers are small helpful assets: checklist, quick tip, estimate range, intro, etc.
