# Lesson 3.3: Finding Opportunities in Daily Interactions

Lead opportunities exist everywhere — but only if you’re paying attention.

This lesson is about awareness, not tactics.

---

## Why Most Opportunities Are Missed

People rush conversations.
They listen for their turn to talk.
They focus on outcomes instead of connection.

Opportunity slips by unnoticed.

---

## What to Listen For

Signals show up in everyday conversation:
- frustration
- curiosity
- uncertainty
- comparison

When someone expresses one of these, they’re revealing a potential need.

---

## How to Respond Without Selling

The goal is not to jump in.
The goal is to stay engaged.

Questions work better than statements:
- “What’s driving that?”
- “How are you thinking about it?”
- “What’s been challenging?”

---

## The Core Skill

You don’t create opportunities.
You **notice** them.

That awareness is what separates natural lead generators from forced ones.
