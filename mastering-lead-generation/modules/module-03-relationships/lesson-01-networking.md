# Lesson 3.1: The Power of Networking

Networking has a bad reputation because most people misunderstand it.

Real networking is not collecting contacts.  
It’s building familiarity and trust over time — sometimes without realizing it.

## What Networking Actually Is

Networking is simply this:
> People knowing who you are, what you do, and how you help.

That’s it.

No scripts. No awkward pitches. No transactional mindset.

## Why Networking Works for Lead Generation

People prefer to do business with:
- people they recognize
- people they trust
- people they feel comfortable referring

Networking creates all three.

## Real-World Networking Moments

Most networking doesn’t happen at events.

It happens:
- in casual conversations
- during introductions
- through shared experiences
- via mutual connections

If you only “network” when you intend to sell, people feel it.

## Key Shift in Mindset

Stop asking:
> “What can I get from this person?”

Start asking:
> “What context am I building with this person?”

That’s where opportunity lives.
