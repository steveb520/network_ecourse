# Module 3 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Relationship Awareness
Think about your last 5 conversations.

For each one, ask:
- Did I listen or wait to talk?
- Did I ask questions or make statements?
- Did I rush the interaction?

---

## Exercise 2: Trust Check
Identify one interaction where trust increased and one where it didn’t.

Write:
- What you did differently
- How the other person responded

---

## Exercise 3: Opportunity Recognition
For the next 3 days, note:
- one moment of frustration
- one moment of curiosity
- one moment of comparison

These are lead signals in disguise.
