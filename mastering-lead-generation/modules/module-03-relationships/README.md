## Why This Matters for Deal Quality

Relationships are not just about referrals.

They influence how you’re introduced, how you’re perceived, and how much credibility you carry before the first conversation begins.

This module begins the shift from casual networking to understanding how professional relationships shape the quality of opportunities you receive.

# Module 3: Building Relationships

Lead generation does not start with a pitch.  
It starts with a relationship — even if that relationship only lasts a few minutes.

In this module, I focus on the part most people skip: **how trust is actually built in everyday interactions**. Not over time, not through manipulation, but through how you show up in conversation.

If you get this module right, everything downstream becomes easier.
