# Module 3: Building Relationships

Lead generation does not start with a pitch.  
It starts with a relationship — even if that relationship only lasts a few minutes.

In this module, I focus on the part most people skip: **how trust is actually built in everyday interactions**. Not over time, not through manipulation, but through how you show up in conversation.

If you get this module right, everything downstream becomes easier.
