# Lesson 3.2: Communication Skills that create trust fast


## Key idea
Write 1–2 sentences in your own words: **what is this lesson really about?**

## Definitions (plain English)
- **Lead:** someone with a problem you can solve *and* a path to becoming a customer (now or later).
- **Signal:** a phrase or behavior that suggests interest, urgency, budget, or authority.
- **Next step:** a small, low-pressure action that moves the relationship forward.

## The framework
### 1) Notice signals
Examples:
- “We’ve been thinking about…”
- “Do you know anyone who…”
- “We’re comparing options…”

### 2) Ask one great question
Use an open-ended question that invites detail:
- “What’s making this important right now?”
- “What have you tried so far?”
- “What would ‘done’ look like?”

### 3) Offer value in 30 seconds
- A quick tip
- A short checklist
- A common mistake to avoid
- A resource you can send

### 4) Permission-based next step
- “Want me to text you that checklist?”
- “If I send a 2-minute summary, would that be useful?”
- “Want to compare notes for 10 minutes this week?”

## Practical examples
Write 2 examples relevant to your work:
1. Situation: ________  Signal: ________  Question: ________  Next step: ________
2. Situation: ________  Signal: ________  Question: ________  Next step: ________

## Mini exercise (5 minutes)
Pick one person you talk to regularly (customer, friend, neighbor, vendor).
- What signals do they show?
- What question would you ask?
- What value can you offer fast?
- What next step can you ask permission for?

## Checklist
- [ ] I can explain this lesson in 1 sentence
- [ ] I have 3 questions ready to use
- [ ] I can name 2 “value offers” I can deliver quickly
