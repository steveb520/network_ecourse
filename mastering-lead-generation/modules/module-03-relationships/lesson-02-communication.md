# Lesson 3.2: Effective Communication Skills

Communication is the foundation of every relationship.

And most communication fails not because of what’s said — but because of **how it’s received**.

---

## What Effective Communication Really Means

Effective communication is not talking more.
It’s making the other person feel:
- heard
- understood
- respected

When that happens, trust follows naturally.

---

## The Role of Listening

Most people listen to respond.
Effective communicators listen to understand.

That means:
- letting pauses exist
- not interrupting
- reflecting back what you hear

Simple changes. Massive impact.

---

## Non-Verbal Signals Matter

Tone, posture, eye contact, and pacing all communicate intent.

If your body language contradicts your words, people believe the body language.

---

## Practical Insight

You don’t build trust by sounding impressive.
You build trust by being present.

People remember how you made them feel — not what you said.
