---

## Lesson 1.1: What Is Lead Generation?
Lead generation is the process of identifying and nurturing people who may benefit from your product or service.

Modern lead generation is **relationship-first**, not pitch-first.

## Lesson 1.2: The Shift to Everyday Lead Generation
Old model:
- Cold calls
- Cold emails
- Interruptions

Modern model:
- Conversations
- Trust
- Timing

Every interaction is a potential lead.

## Practical Exercise
Write down:
- 5 recent conversations you had (work, social, online)
- Note which ones *could* have turned into a lead

---

## Reflection
Where are you already interacting with potential leads without realizing it?
