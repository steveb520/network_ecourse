# Module 1: Introduction to Lead Generation

## Lesson 1.1: Understanding Lead Generation
Lead generation is the process of attracting and converting strangers and prospects into individuals who have indicated interest in your company’s product or service. This interest can take many forms, including conversations, questions, social engagement, or direct inquiries.

Historically, lead generation relied on interruption-based tactics such as cold calling and mass advertising. Modern lead generation is relationship-driven and conversation-based.

Key takeaway: Lead generation begins with listening, not selling.

## Lesson 1.2: Evolution of Lead Generation
Technology has transformed lead generation. Buyers are more informed, more selective, and more resistant to aggressive sales tactics. Businesses that adapt by focusing on trust, education, and timing outperform those that rely on volume alone.

## Lesson 1.3: Inbound vs Outbound
Inbound marketing attracts prospects through value and education. Outbound marketing initiates contact. The most effective strategies combine both approaches with a human-centered mindset.
