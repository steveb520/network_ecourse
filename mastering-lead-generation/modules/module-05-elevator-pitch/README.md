## Why This Matters for Deal Quality

When you become known in your market, opportunity dynamics change.

Price resistance lowers.
Trust builds faster.
Conversations shift.

This module introduces the identity shift from being “a rep” to becoming a recognized name inside your professional ecosystem.

# Module 5: Becoming the Name People Share

The highest-quality leads don’t come from “marketing harder.”
They come from other people saying your name.

This module is about making it easy — and natural — for people in your network to:
- bring you up in conversation
- vouch for you without being asked
- connect you to someone who needs help

I’m not trying to “get referrals.”
I’m building a reputation that travels.
