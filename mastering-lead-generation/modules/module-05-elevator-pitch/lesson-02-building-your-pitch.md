# Lesson 5.2: Build Your “Name Package” (What People Repeat)

If I want people to promote me, I have to give them something they can copy/paste.

I call this my “Name Package.”

It’s not marketing.
It’s a set of simple phrases and tools that help someone introduce me confidently.

## Part 1: The 1-Sentence Identity

This is what someone can say at a party:

“I know someone who helps with ____ for people who ____.”

Examples (generic, not industry-specific):
- “I know someone who helps families make big decisions without stress.”
- “I know someone who helps business owners fix broken systems quickly.”
- “I know someone who helps people get clarity and take action.”

I’m not trying to sound fancy.
I’m trying to be repeatable.

## Part 2: The 3 Proof Points People Can Borrow

These are short and safe:
- Fast response
- Clear communication
- Clean process / no surprises

People don’t want to exaggerate for you.
Give them facts they can say without feeling weird.

Example:
- “They respond fast.”
- “They’re organized.”
- “They don’t disappear after the first call.”

## Part 3: The “Text-Forward” Intro

This is the most practical referral tool:

**A message someone can send to a friend.**

Template:
“Hey — you mentioned ____. I know someone solid who does this. Want an intro?”

If yes:
“Cool. I’ll connect you. They’re responsive and easy to work with.”

I want this to feel like helping a friend, not “selling my guy.”

## Part 4: The Landing Spot (Where People Send Them)

If someone introduces you, what do they send?

Pick ONE:
- your website
- your Calendly link
- your phone number
- your “quick intro” page

The mistake is giving too many options.
Confusion kills action.

## The Goal
When someone thinks of you, the next step should be obvious.
