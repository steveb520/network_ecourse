# Lesson 5.3: Get Warm Intros That Actually Convert

A warm intro is not “someone told me your name.”
A warm intro is:

- context
- trust
- a clear reason you’re being connected
- an easy next step

This lesson is about turning “my buddy gave me your name” into a real conversation.

## Definitions (Plain English)

**Lead**
Someone with a problem you can solve and a path to becoming a customer (now or later).

**Signal**
A phrase or behavior that suggests interest, urgency, budget, or authority.

**Warm intro**
A connection where someone bridges trust and context — not just a name drop.

## The Framework

### 1) Set the intro up the right way (before it happens)

If I want better intros, I tell people exactly how to do it.

I give them this:
“Happy to help. Best way is a quick group text intro so I have context.”

Why?
Because intros die in DMs.
Group text creates momentum.

### 2) Use the “context question” immediately

When the intro comes in, my first move is not selling.
It’s one great question:

- “Appreciate the intro — what’s going on and what are you trying to solve?”
- “What made you start looking at this now?”
- “What would a great outcome look like?”

This turns the intro into a real conversation fast.

### 3) Provide value in under 60 seconds

I don’t pitch.
I give a small win.

Options:
- one helpful tip
- one common mistake to avoid
- one fast checklist
- one clarifying insight

If I can make them feel relief early, trust rises.

### 4) Permission-based next step (low pressure)

I don’t say “When can we meet?”
I say:

- “Want to do a quick 10-minute call so I can point you the right direction?”
- “If I send you a simple checklist, would that help?”
- “If I ask 3 questions I’ll know whether this is something I can help with — want to do that?”

This keeps it easy.
And easy moves forward.

## Why This Works

People don’t convert because of pressure.
They convert because of confidence.

A warm intro is borrowed trust.
My job is to turn borrowed trust into earned trust quickly.
