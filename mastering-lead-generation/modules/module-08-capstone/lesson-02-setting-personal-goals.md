# Lesson 8.2: Document Your Playbook (So You Can Repeat It)

If it’s not written down, it’s not a system.
It’s just vibes.

This lesson is about turning everything into a **one-page playbook** I can reuse.

## The One-Page Lead Playbook

In one sentence:

### Section 5: My follow-up rule
My personal rule:
> “If a conversation mattered, I will follow up within ____________.”

## Why this matters
When my system is written:
- I stop second-guessing
- I sound consistent
- other people can explain me
- I improve faster

This document becomes my **operating manual**.
