## Why This Matters for Deal Quality

Awareness is the first step.

By now, you understand how positioning and relationships influence opportunity quality.

The next question is whether you are actively shaping your positioning — or leaving it to chance.

# Module 8: Capstone — Build Your Personal Lead Engine

This is not a “final exam.”

This is where I stop consuming information and start **owning a system**.

Everything I’ve learned so far only matters if:
- I can explain it simply
- I can run it consistently
- I can improve it over time

The capstone is about turning scattered effort into **one clear operating system** for how leads find me.

## What I’m building by the end
By the end of this module, I should be able to answer — confidently and simply:

1) How do new opportunities usually start for me?
2) Where do my best leads *actually* come from?
3) What do I do when I spot one?
4) How do I follow up without being annoying?
5) How do I make it easy for others to refer me?

If I can’t answer those in plain language, the system isn’t done yet.

## How to use the capstone
- Lesson 8.1 → clarify the system
- Lesson 8.2 → document it
- Lesson 8.3 → commit to running it for 30 days

This isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about **clarity + consistency**.
