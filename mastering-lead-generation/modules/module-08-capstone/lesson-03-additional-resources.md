# Lesson 8.3: The 30-Day Commitment (Make It Real)

Learning without action fades.
Commitment turns this into momentum.

This lesson is about choosing **consistency over intensity**.

---

## The 30-Day Rule
For the next 30 days, I will:
- run my system
- track simple metrics
- adjust once per week

No rebuilding. No restarting. Just running it.

---

## My weekly commitments

### Each week I will:
- start ____ meaningful conversations
- send ____ follow-ups
- ask for ____ referrals or introductions

Write your numbers:
- Conversations: ______
- Follow-ups: ______
- Intros/referrals: ______

Keep them realistic.

---

## My tracking method
I don’t need a CRM.
I need awareness.

I will track in:
- notes app / spreadsheet / notebook

Each entry includes:
- who I talked to
- what they mentioned
- what I did next

That’s enough.

---

## My weekly review question
At the end of each week, I ask:
> “What worked, and what do I adjust slightly next week?”

One change. Not ten.

---

## My commitment statement
Write this and actually mean it:

> “For the next 30 days, I commit to running my lead system consistently — even when it feels small or slow.”
