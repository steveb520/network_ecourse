# Lesson 8.1: Design Your Personal Lead System

A lead system doesn’t need to be complex.
It needs to be **clear**.

This lesson is about designing something I can actually remember and use.

---

## Step 1: Identify your top 3 lead sources
Not where leads *could* come from.
Where they *actually* come from.

Examples:
- referrals from existing relationships
- introductions from my network
- conversations at work or events
- inbound from content
- follow-up from past conversations

### My top 3:
1) __________________
2) __________________
3) __________________

If I focus on these three, everything else becomes optional.

---

## Step 2: Define my “lead moment”
A lead doesn’t start when someone says “send me a proposal.”

It starts when:
- a problem is mentioned
- a signal is given
- a question is asked
- uncertainty shows up

### My most common lead moment:
> “When someone says or does ____________, that’s my signal.”

Write it clearly:
______________________________________

---

## Step 3: Choose my default response
I don’t want to improvise every time.

I want a **default move**.

My default response includes:
1) one good question
2) one piece of value
3) one next step

### My default response (write it out):
Question:
______________________________________

Value:
______________________________________

Next step:
______________________________________

If I can remember this, I’ll never feel awkward again.

## Step 4: Decide what “success” looks like
Success is not “closing the deal.”

Success is:
- starting the conversation
- earning trust
- setting a next step

### My success metric:
> “If I do ____________, I did my job.”

Examples:
- sent the follow-up
- made the introduction
- scheduled the next conversation
- delivered value

This keeps me focused on inputs, not pressure.
