# Alliance Positioning Diagnostic

You now understand how positioning and professional relationships influence deal quality.

The question is not whether positioning matters.

The question is whether you are actively controlling it.

Take a few minutes and answer honestly.

## 1. Deal Source Breakdown

Estimate the percentage of your opportunities that come from:

• Company marketing: _____ %
• Cold outreach or canvassing: _____ %
• Repeat customers: _____ %
• Strategic industry relationships: _____ %

Now ask yourself:

If company marketing slowed down 30% tomorrow, what would happen to your income?

## 2. Opportunity Temperature

Rate each from 1 (rarely) to 5 (consistently):

• Buyers already trust you before the appointment.
• You are recommended by name.
• You face minimal price comparison.
• Buyers mention someone who spoke positively about you.
• You walk into conversations that feel pre-framed.

If most answers are below 4, your positioning is not yet working for you.

## 3. Market Visibility

Answer yes or no:

• Do realtors in your territory know what you specialize in?
• Do builders or related trades think of you first?
• Have you mapped your local professional ecosystem?
• Do you have recurring touchpoints with related industries?
• Are you top-of-mind outside of your company?

If not, your market visibility is passive — not strategic.

## 4. Identity Check

Right now, are you:

A) Competing inside your territory  
B) Positioned inside your territory  

There is a difference.

Competing requires effort every time.

Positioning creates leverage over time.

## 5. The Real Question

Are you relying on:

• Skill alone?
• Company marketing?
• Luck of the draw?

Or are you building:

• Strategic alliances?
• Cross-industry leverage?
• Market positioning?

Understanding positioning is valuable.

Building it changes everything.
