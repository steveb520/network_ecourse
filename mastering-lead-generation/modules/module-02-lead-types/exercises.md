# Module 2 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Identify the Lead Type
Think of 5 recent conversations.

For each one, write:
- What did the person say?
- Were they curious or committed?
- MQL or SQL?

---

## Exercise 2: Score the Conversation
Give each conversation a score from 1–5 based on:
- Engagement
- Specificity
- Urgency

---

## Exercise 3: Adjust Your Response
Rewrite how you *should* have followed up with each person,
based on their actual lead type.

This is where improvement happens.
