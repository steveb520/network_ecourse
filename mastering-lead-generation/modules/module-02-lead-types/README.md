## Why This Matters for Deal Quality

Not all opportunities are created equal.

Understanding lead types isn’t just about classification — it’s about recognizing how positioning influences opportunity temperature, trust level, and buyer intent.

Some opportunities are cold and competitive.
Others are warm and pre-framed.

The difference is rarely luck — it’s positioning.

# Module 2: Lead Types

In this module, I’m going to slow things down and bring clarity to one of the most misunderstood parts of lead generation: **what kind of lead you’re actually talking to**.

Most people treat every conversation the same. That’s a mistake.

The way you talk to someone who is *curious* should be completely different from the way you talk to someone who is *ready to act*. If you don’t make that distinction, you either push too hard or wait too long — and both cost you opportunities.
