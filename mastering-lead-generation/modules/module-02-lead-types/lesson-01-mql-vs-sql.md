# Lesson 2.1: Marketing Qualified Leads vs Sales Qualified Leads

One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is assuming that *interest* means *readiness*.

It doesn’t.

Someone can be interested, curious, even enthusiastic — and still not be ready to take action. Understanding this distinction changes how you communicate and how you follow up.

## Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)

A Marketing Qualified Lead is someone who has raised their hand *a little*.

They are saying:
> “This sounds interesting. Tell me more.”

They are **not** saying:
> “I’m ready to decide.”

### Real-World Examples
- Someone asks how something works, but not how much it costs
- Someone downloads a guide or resource
- Someone engages in conversation but avoids specifics

Your job with an MQL is **education and trust-building**, not closing.

## Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

A Sales Qualified Lead shows **intent**, not just curiosity.

They are saying:
> “I’m considering action, and I’m evaluating options.”

### Real-World Signals
- They ask about pricing, timing, or next steps
- They mention constraints (budget, schedule, approval)
- They compare options out loud

With an SQL, clarity beats persuasion. They want help deciding, not convincing.

## Why This Matters

If you treat an MQL like an SQL, you create pressure.
If you treat an SQL like an MQL, you create friction.

Most lost deals aren’t “lost” — they’re mishandled.

## Key Takeaway
Your job is not to push people forward.  
Your job is to **meet them where they already are**.
