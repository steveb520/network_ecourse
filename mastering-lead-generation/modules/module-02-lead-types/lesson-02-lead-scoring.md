# Lesson 2.2: Lead Scoring in the Real World

Lead scoring sounds technical, but at its core it’s simple:

> How much attention should this person get *right now*?

Time is your most limited resource. Lead scoring protects it.

## What Lead Scoring Is (and Isn’t)

Lead scoring is not about labeling people.
It’s about **prioritizing action**.

A simple mental model works better than a complex system.

## A Practical Scoring Framework

I use three categories:

### 1. Engagement
Are they responsive? Do they ask questions? Do they follow up?

### 2. Specificity
Are they vague, or are they talking in specifics?

### 3. Urgency
Is there a reason something needs to happen soon?

Each category gives you signal.

## Example

Two people say they’re “interested.”

- Person A asks general questions and disappears for weeks.
- Person B asks how long the process takes and what the next step is.

Same word. Completely different priority.

## The Point
You’re not ranking people by importance.
You’re ranking **conversations by momentum**.

That’s how you stay effective without burning out.
