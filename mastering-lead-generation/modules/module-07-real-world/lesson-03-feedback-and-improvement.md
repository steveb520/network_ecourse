# Lesson 7.3: Feedback & Improvement (My Weekly Upgrade Loop)

If I don’t build a system for improvement, my lead gen skills plateau.

I’ll get “pretty good” — and then stay there.

This lesson is my simple loop for getting better every week without making it complicated.

## The truth about feedback
Feedback isn’t only “someone critiquing me.”

Feedback is:
- responses I get (or don’t)
- how often people refer me
- whether people take the next step
- what questions keep coming up

The market gives feedback constantly. I just have to notice it.

## My weekly review (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Capture moments (during the week)
I keep a simple note with 5 bullets:
- Who did I talk to?
- What problem did they mention?
- What did I say?
- What was the next step?
- What happened after?

### Step 2: Pick one “moment to improve”
Not 10 things. One.

Examples:
- “I talked too much before asking a question.”
- “My next step was vague.”
- “I didn’t follow up quickly.”
- “I didn’t make it easy for them to refer me.”

### Step 3: Write the better version
I rewrite the moment in 3 lines:
1) the question I should have asked
2) the 30-second value I should have offered
3) the next step I should have suggested

### Step 4: Practice it once (role-play)
Then I role-play that exact moment once.

That’s it. That’s the loop.

## Getting feedback from real people (without being annoying)

### Low-friction question to ask a friend/colleague
> “Quick question — when you describe what I do to someone else, what do you say?”

This tells me instantly:
- if my message is clear
- what people actually remember
- what I’m becoming known for

### After a referral (best time to learn)
> “Thank you again for connecting us — what made you feel confident sending them my way?”

That answer is gold. It tells me what to double down on.

## My improvement scoreboard (simple)
Each week I track just 3 numbers:
1) **Meaningful conversations started**
2) **Follow-ups sent**
3) **Warm intros or referrals generated**

Then I ask:
- Which one is the bottleneck?
- What tiny change improves it?

Consistency beats intensity here.
