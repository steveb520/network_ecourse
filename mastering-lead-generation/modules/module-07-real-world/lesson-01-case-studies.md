# Lesson 7.1: Case Studies (Patterns You Can Copy)

Most people think “lead generation” is a personality trait — like you either have it or you don’t.

I don’t buy that.

The best lead generators I know aren’t the loudest people. They’re the people who:
- notice repeatable patterns
- show up consistently
- follow up without making it awkward
- make it easy for others to help them

This lesson is a set of **patterns** I can copy.

## Case Study Pattern #1: The “Helpful Specialist” (trust > charisma)

**Situation:** Someone mentions a problem casually.  
**Most people:** nod and move on.  
**What I do:** I offer a small, specific next step that reduces their uncertainty.

### What this looks like in the real world
Someone says:
- “We’re thinking about switching systems.”
- “We’ve had a hard time hiring.”
- “I keep getting inconsistent results.”
- “We need a better process.”

I respond with:
1) **One clarifying question**
2) **One 30-second helpful insight**
3) **One low-pressure next step**

### Example (script)
> “What’s the main thing you want to improve — speed, cost, or quality?”  
> “Got it. One thing that usually helps is ____ (quick insight).”  
> “If you want, I can send you a simple checklist I use. Want that?”

**Why it works:** it’s not a pitch. It’s a contribution.  
**Leads come later** because I became a safe person to talk to.

## Case Study Pattern #2: The “Connector” (I win by connecting others)

**Situation:** I meet two people who could help each other.  
**Most people:** think “cool” and do nothing.  
**What I do:** I introduce them with clarity and context.

### Example intro message (copy/paste)
> “Hey Alex — meet Jordan. Alex is working on ____. Jordan has done ____.  
> I thought you two should connect because _____.  
> If it’s helpful, I’ll let you take it from here.”

**Why it works:**  
When I become someone who **creates value between other people**, they remember me and bring me into opportunities later.

This is one of the fastest “quiet” ways to build network power.

## Case Study Pattern #3: The “Consistent Presence” (familiarity creates inbound)

**Situation:** People don’t refer who they don’t remember.  
**What I do:** I stay lightly visible in a way that feels normal.

### What I post (simple, repeatable)
- one lesson learned this week
- one mistake I see people make
- one tiny framework
- one short story with a takeaway

### The rule I follow
If someone saw my content once a week for 8 weeks, could they answer:
- what I do
- who I help
- what I’m known for

If not, I simplify my message.

## Case Study Pattern #4: The “Follow-Up Pro” (I don’t let good moments die)

**Situation:** A good conversation ends.  
**Most people:** “We should stay in touch” and nothing happens.  
**What I do:** I choose a next step immediately.

### The 3 next steps I use most
1) **Send a resource** (checklist, example, template)
2) **Make a warm intro** to someone who helps them
3) **Schedule a short call** with a clear purpose

### My follow-up rule
If I can’t describe the next step in one sentence, it’s too big.

Good:
- “I’ll send you that checklist today.”
- “Want me to introduce you to Sam?”

Bad:
- “Let’s circle back sometime.”

## Your takeaway (what I want to remember)
Case studies aren’t inspiration. They’re **recipes**.

I’m not trying to be “good at networking.”  
I’m trying to run a few repeatable plays so leads become predictable.
