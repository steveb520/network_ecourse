# Module 7: Real-World Application (Make It Real)

This module is where everything stops being “training content” and starts becoming **a repeatable system**.

Up to now, you’ve learned:
- what a lead really is (and what it isn’t)
- how relationships create opportunities
- how social presence creates familiarity
- how referrals make your name travel
- how follow-up turns “nice chat” into momentum

Now we pressure-test it in real situations:
- real conversations
- real objections
- real uncertainty
- real follow-up timelines

## What I’m trying to build (my outcome)
By the end of this module, I want a simple, honest answer to these questions:

1) **Where do my best leads actually come from?**  
2) **What are the 3–5 repeatable moments that create them?**  
3) **What do I do next, consistently, when I spot one?**  
4) **How do I improve without getting weird or salesy?**

## How to use Module 7
- Read Lesson 7.1 and choose **one case study pattern** to copy this week.
- Do Lesson 7.2 role-plays **out loud** (even alone — it works).
- Use Lesson 7.3 to build a feedback loop so your skills improve every week.
