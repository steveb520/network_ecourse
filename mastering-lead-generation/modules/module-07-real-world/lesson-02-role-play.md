# Lesson 7.2: Role-Playing (Reps Create Confidence)

Role-playing feels cheesy until I realize something:

**Every real conversation is a performance anyway.**

If I don’t practice, I’m practicing live — with real consequences.

This lesson is about building “muscle memory” so I don’t freeze, ramble, or get salesy.

## The 3 role-play scenarios I actually need

### Scenario A: The casual mention
Someone casually says:
- “We’re looking at options.”
- “We’ve been thinking about it.”
- “I might need help with that.”

**My goal:** keep it human + create a next step.

**Script**
1) Reflect: “That makes sense.”
2) Question: “What’s making it important right now?”
3) Value: “One thing that usually helps is ____.”
4) Next step: “Want me to send you ____?”

### Scenario B: The referral moment
Someone says:
- “Do you know anyone who can help?”
- “Who would you recommend?”
- “I’m trying to find someone reliable.”

**My goal:** earn trust + make the handoff easy.

**Script**
> “Yes — I can help / I know someone. Quick question: what matters most to you — speed, price, or quality?”  
> “Got it. The reason I’m confident recommending ____ is ____.”  
> “If you want, I can connect you two. What’s the best number/email?”

### Scenario C: The objection (without getting defensive)
Someone says:
- “We’re not ready.”
- “We’re just looking.”
- “We’re talking to a few people.”

**My goal:** reduce pressure, increase clarity.

**Script**
> “Totally fair. Most people start there.”  
> “When you say ‘not ready,’ is it timing, budget, or just uncertainty?”  
> “If it helps, I can send a simple comparison checklist so you don’t get burned.”

This works because I’m not trying to “win” the moment — I’m trying to stay in the game.

## How to role-play (without needing another person)

### Solo method (5 minutes)
- Read the prompt out loud
- Speak your answer out loud
- Record a voice memo
- Listen once and adjust one thing

### What I listen for
- Did I ramble?
- Did I ask a real question?
- Did I offer something concrete?
- Did I set a next step?

## A simple grading scale (keep it objective)
After each role-play, score myself 1–5:

1) **Clarity**: could someone repeat what I do?
2) **Curiosity**: did I ask a strong question?
3) **Value**: did I give a useful insight?
4) **Next step**: did I suggest something easy?

Improvement = one point higher next week, not perfection today.
