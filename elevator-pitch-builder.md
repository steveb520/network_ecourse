# Connection Builder Workshop (20–30 Minutes)
## Create an intro people actually repeat (so your name spreads)

This isn’t an “elevator pitch.”  
This is a **connection script**: a simple, human way to describe you that other people can confidently share.

My goal is to make it easy for someone to say:
> “You should talk to ___.”

No awkward selling. No hype. Just clarity + trust.

# How this works (what I’m building)
By the end of this workshop, I will have:

1) **A 1-sentence “what I do” line** that’s easy to repeat  
2) **A 10–15 second intro** someone can say in conversation  
3) **A “text-forward intro”** someone can copy/paste to connect me  
4) **A short list of “signals”** that tell people when to bring me up  
5) A **simple ask** that activates my network without being weird

# Workshop Agenda (20–30 minutes)

## Part 1 (3 minutes): What makes people share a name
People share your name when:
- they can describe you in one sentence
- they trust you won’t embarrass them
- they know *when* to bring you up
- the next step is easy

**Rule:** If someone can’t explain you quickly, they won’t recommend you—even if they like you.

## Part 2 (7 minutes): Build your “repeatable identity”
### A) Your 1-sentence line (the core)
Fill in the blanks:

**I help** ____________  
**who are dealing with** ____________  
**so they can** ____________.

Examples:
- I help busy people who feel overwhelmed by decisions so they can move forward confidently.
- I help teams who are stuck in messy processes so they can simplify and execute.
- I help business owners who want more consistent growth so they can build a repeatable pipeline.

Write yours:
> I help __________________________________________  
> who are dealing with ______________________________  
> so they can ______________________________________.

### B) Remove jargon (make it human)
Rewrite your sentence in “friend language” (no industry terms):

> Friend version: ___________________________________

## Part 3 (7 minutes): Give people a reason to bring you up
People recommend you when they can recognize the moment you’re useful.

### A) Pick 3 “signals”
Signals are phrases someone says right before they need help.

Common signal starters:
- “We’ve been thinking about…”
- “Do you know anyone who…”
- “We’re comparing options…”
- “This has been a headache…”
- “I’m not sure what to do about…”

Write 3 signals your audience says:
1) ________________________________________________
2) ________________________________________________
3) ________________________________________________

### B) The “when to mention me” line
This is what you want others to remember:

> “If you hear someone say ________, that’s when to bring me up.”

Write yours:
> If you hear someone say ___________________________, that’s when to bring me up.

---

## Part 4 (7 minutes): Create introductions that travel
### A) The 10–15 second spoken intro (for group settings)
This is what someone can say out loud:

> “This is ___ — they help ___ who are dealing with ___.  
> If you ever run into ___, they’re the person to talk to.”

Write your version:
> This is __________ — they help _____________________  
> who are dealing with ______________________________.  
> If you ever run into _______________________________, they’re the person to talk to.

### B) The copy/paste text intro (most powerful)
This is what someone can send on your behalf:

**Template:**
> “Hey — you mentioned ____. I know someone solid who helps with that. Want an intro?”

**If yes:**
> “Great. Adding them here—(Name), quick context: ____.  
> They’re great at ____. I’ll let you two take it from here.”

Write your version (copy/paste ready):

**Message 1:**
> Hey — you mentioned _______________________________.  
> I know someone solid who helps with that. Want an intro?

**Message 2 (group text):**
> Great. Adding them here — (Name), quick context: ________.  
> They’re great at ____________________________________.  
> I’ll let you two take it from here.

## Part 5 (3–5 minutes): Activate your network (without being weird)
I’m not asking people to “send referrals.”
I’m giving them a simple way to introduce me when it naturally fits.

### The easy activation message (send to 3 people)
> “Quick ask — if you hear anyone mention (signal), I’d appreciate you thinking of me.  
> Here’s the easiest way to introduce me (copy/paste):  
> [paste Message 1 + Message 2]”

Pick 3 people to send it to:
1) ____________________
2) ____________________
3) ____________________

---

# Practice (optional, 5 minutes)
Pair up with someone and do this:

1) Person A reads their 10–15 second intro out loud  
2) Person B answers: “So you help when ____ happens?”  
3) Person A refines one sentence to be clearer

**Success test:** Can the other person repeat your intro without looking?

---

# Your final “Name Package” (save this)
Copy/paste these into your notes:

**1-sentence identity:**  
______________________________________

**3 signals:**  
1) ____________________  
2) ____________________  
3) ____________________

**Spoken intro (10–15 sec):**  
______________________________________

**Text intro Message 1:**  
______________________________________

**Text intro Message 2:**  
______________________________________

# If you want me to tighten it
Paste your 1-sentence identity + 3 signals and I’ll rewrite it to be:
- simpler
- more repeatable
- more “introducible”
