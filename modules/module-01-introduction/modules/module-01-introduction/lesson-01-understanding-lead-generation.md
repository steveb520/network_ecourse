# Lesson 1.1 – Understanding Lead Generation

## Definition
Lead generation is the intentional process of identifying and beginning
relationships with people who have a relevant problem, interest, or need
that you are positioned to help solve.

A lead is **not**:
- Someone who liked a post
- Someone you pitched once
- Someone you pressured into a conversation

A lead **is**:
- Someone who has expressed curiosity, frustration, or intent
- Someone experiencing a problem you understand
- Someone open to continued conversation

## Key Insight
Lead generation begins with **listening**, not selling.

Everyday conversations are full of lead signals:
- Complaints
- Comparisons
- Questions
- Timing statements

## Real-World Examples
- “We’ve been frustrated with our current provider.”
- “Do you know anyone who handles…?”
- “We’ve been thinking about making a change.”

These are not small talk.
They are lead opportunities.
