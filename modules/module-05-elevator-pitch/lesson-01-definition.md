# Lesson 5.1: Why People Share Names (and What Stops Them)

People don’t promote you because you’re good.
They promote you because it’s easy and safe to do it.

When someone recommends you, they’re risking their own reputation.

So if I want my name to travel, I have to answer two questions for them:
1) Is this person reliable?
2) Can I explain what they do in one sentence?

## The Real Reasons People Share Someone’s Name

### 1) Clarity
If they can’t describe you quickly, they won’t bring you up.

If my work sounds like a paragraph, it won’t spread.
If it sounds like a clean sentence, it will.

### 2) Confidence
They share names they trust won’t embarrass them.
Reliability beats charisma.

### 3) Timing
People don’t refer from memory.
They refer from *recent reminders*.

### 4) A story they can retell
They want something simple like:
- “They saved my friend from a mess.”
- “They were fast and honest.”
- “They handled it without drama.”

## What Stops People From Sharing Your Name

- They don’t know what to say
- They don’t know who you help
- They aren’t sure you’ll respond quickly
- They don’t know what happens after the intro

**If I want introductions, I have to remove friction.**

## My Rule
If someone wants to recommend me, I should make it:
- easy to say
- easy to send
- safe to vouch for
- clear what happens next
